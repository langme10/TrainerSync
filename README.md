<b>[Try it out](https://trainersync-937221154891.us-central1.run.app)</b>

<h2>Description</h2>
TrainerSync is a **personal training management platform** built to streamline client scheduling, workouts, and communication.  
It began as a tool to help me organize my real personal training sessions at Powerhouse Gym, but evolved into a full-stack scheduling system that connects trainers and clients through a clean, responsive interface.

The goal: simplify the business side of training so coaches can focus on what matters — their clients.
